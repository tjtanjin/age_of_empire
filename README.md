### Introduction
Age of Empire is a mini turn-based strategy war game between the Egyptians and the Greeks! I recently picked up programming (Python 3 to be specific) and decided to try out classes/functions through creating a simple game. I make mini updates from time to time whenever I feel that it can further my learning and practice! It's nothing fanciful but still an original work I am proud of nonetheless! :)

Note: Age of Empire has since received a playable Telegram bot version (albeit without AI options) whose work can be found in this repository:
```

```

### Features
Age of Empire is ran directly on the terminal and has options for the following gameplay:
```
1) Player versus Player
2) Player versus AI
3) AI vs AI
```
In addition to choosing gamemodes, the difficulty of the AI is also configurable (up to 4 different difficulties!) for players who would love a challenge! That said, the logic behind the decisions of the AI is very simple so skimming through the code might shed light on some useful strategies!
